### Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)

My throbber design itself is very basic and mostly uses the given example code with minor modifications, most of my time have been spent
on the loading bar below in addition to the story driven voice interaction.

I came to the conclusion that often when interacting with any kind of loading screen or throbber you feel a sense of frustration and at times
even anger, so i thought. **What if you could talk to your throbber and convince it to go faster?**

My design is a very early prototype, meaning, if you decide not to follow the instructions given by clippy, the program will most 
likely not work as intended.
Also, pronunciation is important,so speak slowly and if nothing happens at first, try again. 

P.S: Secret keyword: **Flower**




### How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
Programming is as much a forum for inquiring digital culture as any other media.
In a broader view you can argue that everything is programmed, and therefore everything that exist in the digial spectre therefore originates from programming, while i don't think that's the focus of this question, it's a consideration worth making.

Digital culture understood as the relationship between technology and culture is a broad field packed with information and material, everything from electronic literature, communcation tools, online videogames as a cultural arenas, the use of social networks and much much more that connects us with the technology that surround us, and to answer the question given,  programming is just one of the tools we can utilize to understand this broad and undefinded field.
